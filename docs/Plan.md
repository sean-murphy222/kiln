# CHONK

When building chonk ensure you're building using the best scalable programing methods. The files should not be monolithic and should be easily maintainble.

We want to have a modern take on a pixel art theme. We want consistent styling applied everywhere, whether this is for CLI, extension, or a desktop application.

Consider security while you're building and ensure that we have a product that is built to pass security scans and maintain peoples information safely.
